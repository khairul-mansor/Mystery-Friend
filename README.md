# Mystery-Friend

I’ve received an anonymous postcard from a friend who I haven’t seen in years. My friend did not leave a name, but the card is definitely addressed to me. So far, I’ve narrowed my search down to three friends, based on handwriting:

	Emma Goldman

	Matthew Henson

	TingFang Wu

 

But which one sent me the card?

Just like I can classify a message as spam or not spam with a spam filter, I can classify writing as related to one friend or another by building a kind of friend writing classifier. I have past writing from all three friends stored up in the variable friends_docs, which means I can use scikit-learn’s bag-of-words and Naive Bayes classifier to determine who the mystery friend is!


### Result

Technologies used: Python, scikit-learn

Used scikit-learn’s bag-of-words and Naive Bayes Classifier to determine who the mystery friend is based on past writing from all three friends
